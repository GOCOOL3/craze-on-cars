   </h3></div>
  <div class="c11"> <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forzamotorsport/images/8/85/HOR_XB1_Zenvo_ST1.png/revision/latest?cb=20191014201541" alt="" ; width="700px"></div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p class="c111">The Zenvo ST1 is a high performance sports car manufactured by Danish company Zenvo Automotive. It is the company's first model and is manufactured almost entirely by the hands of a small team of workers, with the exception of a CNC router.
      <br>
      Functionalistic and immediately aesthetically iconic, the Zenvo ST1 was developed over six years. It was the first incarnation of the Zenvo brand in a unique hypercar and featured a unique twin charger system combining a super charger and a turbo charger – hence the model name ST1.
      <br>
      Unveiled at the 24-hour Le Mans ‘Drivers Parade’ in 2009, the ST1 prototype was nominated as ‘Super Car of the Year’. Its introduction caused a great stir in the hypercar world and Zenvo – at the time an unknown Danish car manufacturer –achieved in record time what others spend a decade creating: a hypercar with cutting-edge styling and a staggering performance.
      <br>
      A supercharged and turbocharged twin charging engine was a way in which the low-down power could be delivered and yet retain an increased boost as the revs built. The supercharger provided the initial power while the turbocharger increased power at higher revs. But this wasn’t the optimum solution for us. The ST1 led to the three TS-model options of today.

   <div class="c11"> <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forzamotorsport/images/5/5a/HOR_XB1_Ferrari_LaFerrari.png/revision/latest?cb=20191021122528" alt="" ; width="700px"></div>
   <br>
   <br>
   <p class="c111">It boasts the most extreme performance ever achieved by a Ferrari production car and features the most advanced and innovative technical solutions which will, in the future, filter down to the rest of the Ferrari range. The LaFerrari is Ferrari’s first ever production car to be equipped with the F1-derived hybrid solution – the HY-KERS system – which combines an electric motor producing over 150 CV with the most powerful incarnation yet of Ferrari’s classic V12, with 800 CV at 9000 rpm.
       <br>
       The LaFerrari’s architecture represents the pinnacle of innovation even by Ferrari’s legendary standards. The objective was to increase aerodynamic efficiency, deliver ideal weight distribution, lower the car’s centre of gravity as far as possible, and, most importantly of all, seamlessly integrate the new hybrid system.All of this and more has been achieved without impinging on cabin space, comfort or accessibility.

On 11 February 2015 it was reported that the Pagani Huayra has been sold out. The Huayra was limited to just 100 units as part of Pagani's agreement with engine supplier Mercedes-AMG.[5]

         The Pagani Huayra was officially debuted online with several pictures in a press release on 25 January 2011.[4][6][7] The official world debut was at the headquarters of Pirelli in Milan in February 2011.

     <br>
     <br>
     <p class="c111">Despite its massive price tag and limited production run, the Ferrari F60 America is based on a “regular” production model, the F12betrlinetta. As a result, the special edition model gets the same naturally-aspirated 730-hp V12 upfront and traction going to the rear wheels exclusively. According to Car and Driver, this allows the F60 America to shoot to 60 mph in around 3.1 seconds.
         <br>
         Despite its F12berlinetta base, the F60 America has a completely distinct look. This means you get a completely redesigned exterior. From the sculpted fenders to the rear arches behind the driver, this Ferrari looks completely unique.
         <br>
         However, the big differentiator and the main reason this model is special is that it has no roof. Since the regular production model only exists as a coupe, this rare model was the only way you could experience that V12 powertrain at the time without a roof. However, this car’s interior is where things truly get weird.

     <br>
     <br>
     <p class="c111">The Bugatti Veyron is one of the most seminal supercars of the 21st century. At the time, it was the most powerful production car in the world when it launched in 2005, and, despite being surpassed by the 1,500-hp Chiron, is still sought-after by car collectors. Only 270 examples of the original 16.4 Veyron variant were produced, but for those who wanted to make it more exclusive, German car customization Masonry applied its tuning talents to a handful of Veyrons. One of its best-known creations was the Veyron Linea Vivere.
        Only two exist in the world, one of which is listed for sale on James Edition. Aside from its quad turbocharged 8.0-liter W16 engine and unique customization job, what makes this Veyron even more special is that it happens to be the third model that rolled off the production line in 2007. You would think that would already make it extremely collectable and valuable, but the owner decided to send the supercar to Mansory to make it even more unique. Finished in Matte White, the exterior features a striking Mansory Carbon Fiber weave, new carbon front and rear bumpers, and a redesigned hood. Mansory also added daytime running lights, side skirts and fully forged custom wheels.

<p class="c111">The Koenigsegg CCX is a mid-engine sports car manufactured by Swedish automotive manufacturer Koenigsegg Automotive AB. The project began with the aim of making a global car, designed and engineered to comply with global safety and environment regulations, particularly to enter the United States car market. To sell cars in the US, many alterations were made to the design of the CCR; the previously used Ford Modular engine was replaced by an in-house developed Koenigsegg engine designed to run on 91 octane fuel, readily available in the United States, and to meet the Californian emission standards.[4][5]
